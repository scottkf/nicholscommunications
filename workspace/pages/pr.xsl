	<h2>Public Relations</h2>


	<p>You have one of two goals in mind when you hire us for public relations work:</p>

	<ol>
	<li>You want to promote your product or service to a specific audience not normally reached by traditional avenues and media.</li>
	<li>You are in crisis. For some reason, it's hitting the fan.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>In both cases, your goal is the same...to present your company in the best light possible. However, although both scenarios present the possibility of OPPORTUNITY, the tactics used are completely different. Most companies fail miserably when confronted with a public relations crisis. We will prepare you, beforehand and during a crisis situation, to deal with it properly.</p>
