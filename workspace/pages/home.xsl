	We are a small group of management and advertising people committed to determining and then promoting the simple truths of your business.
</p>
<p>
	Our initial focus when we first go to work for you is to revisit the features that first appealed to your customers, along with the reasons your customers keep coming back. These are the FUNDAMENTALS that allowed you to succeed in the first place. Over time, distractions increase exponentially and your focus (and attention) go elsewhere. We are here to help you rebuild the basic truths of your business...your brand. Then we work on the ongoing steps...we turn our focus to CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT.
</p>

<p>
	The world is complicated enough. We keep it simple.
